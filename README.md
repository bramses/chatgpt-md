## What's New in v2.12.0-beta 🚀
### 🔒 Privacy-First AI Tool Calling

- **Vault Search**: AI can search your notes—but only shares files YOU approve
- **Web Search**: AI can search the web via Brave Search API (1,000 free queries/month)
- **Three-Layer Approval**: Approve execution → Review results → Select what to share
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: No data reaches the AI without your explicit consent
- **All Providers Supported**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio
- **Disabled by Default**: Opt-in feature only—enable in Settings → Tool Calling

⚠️ **Beta Warning**: Test on backup/test vault first. Install via [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) and select version **2.12.0-beta**.

## A simple and quick Start 🏁
Get started in just a few simple steps:

1. **Install ChatGPT MD**: Go to `Settings > Community Plugins > Browse`, search for `ChatGPT MD` and click `Install`.
2. **Add your OpenAI API key**: In the plugin settings, add your OpenAI API key and/or install Ollama and local LLMs of your choice.
3. **Start chatting**: Use the `ChatGPT MD: Chat` command (`cmd + p` or `ctrl + p`) to start a conversation from any note.

💡 *Pro tip*: Set up a hotkey for the best experience! Go to `Settings > Hotkeys`, search for `ChatGPT MD: Chat` and add your preferred keybinding (e.g., `cmd + j`).

Start chatting, don't worry too much about the more advanced features. They will come naturally :-) 

## Local LLM Setup (Ollama & LM Studio) 🏠

Want to keep your conversations private and avoid API costs? Use local LLMs with ChatGPT MD!

### Ollama Setup

1. **Install Ollama**: Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) and install on your system
2. **Download a model**: Run in terminal:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2    # or any model of your choice
   ollama pull qwen2.5     # another popular option
   ```
3. **Configure ChatGPT MD**:
   - Go to `Settings > ChatGPT MD > Ollama Defaults`
   - The Ollama URL should already be set to `http://localhost:11434`
   - Set your default model in the settings (e.g., `ollama@llama3.2`)
4. **Start chatting**: Use the `ChatGPT MD: Chat` command to start conversations with your configured default model, or override it in individual notes:
   ```yaml
   ---
   model: ollama@llama3.2  # Override default if needed
   temperature: 0.7
   ---
   ```

### LM Studio Setup

1. **Install LM Studio**: Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. **Download and load a model** in LM Studio
3. **Start the server**: In LM Studio, go to Local Server and start it
4. **Configure ChatGPT MD**:
   - Go to `Settings > ChatGPT MD > LM Studio Defaults`
   - The LM Studio URL should be set to `http://localhost:1234`
   - Set your default model in the settings (e.g., `lmstudio@your-model-name`)
5. **Start chatting**: Use the `ChatGPT MD: Chat` command to start conversations with your configured default model, or override it in individual notes:
   ```yaml
   ---
   model: lmstudio@your-model-name  # Override default if needed
   temperature: 0.7
   ---
   ```

### Finding Your Model Names

- **Ollama**: Run `ollama list` in terminal to see installed models
- **LM Studio**: Check the model name in LM Studio's interface when the model is loaded

### Important Notes for Local LLMs

- **Default Model Configuration**: Set your preferred local model as the default in settings - it works just like cloud services
- **Per-Note Overrides**: You can override the default model in individual notes using frontmatter, same as with other providers
- **Model Discovery**: Use `ollama list` (Ollama) or check LM Studio interface to find your available model names for configuration

## Privacy and Security

ChatGPT MD is 
- only storing data locally in your vault, with zero tracking and no 3rd party integrations except direct calls to the AI APIs (OpenAI, OpenRouter.ai).
- allowing you to use Ollama, a local LLM installation for offline conversation-based knowledge exploration.

### Default Configuration
The plugin comes with a well-balanced pre-configuration to get you started immediately. 
You can change the global settings or use the local parameters in any note via frontmatter
(start typing `---` in the first line of your note to add properties)
```
---
system_commands: ['You are a helpful assistant.']
temperature: 0.3
top_p: 1
max_tokens: 300
presence_penalty: 0.5
frequency_penalty: 0.5
stream: true
stop: null
n: 1
model: gpt-5-mini

# Service-specific URLs (optional, will use global settings if not specified)
openaiUrl: https://api.openai.com
# openrouterUrl: https://openrouter.ai
# ollamaUrl: http://localhost:11434
---
```
💡 Pro tip: Increasing `max_tokens` to a higher value e.g. `4096` for more complex tasks like reasoning, coding or text creation.
The default model `gpt-5-mini` is optimized for speed and efficiency. Upgrade to `gpt-5` for enhanced reasoning capabilities or use `gpt-5-nano` for ultra-lightweight responses.

### Multi Model Chats
You can set and change the model for each request in your note. 
Specify the `model` property via frontmatter:

for OpenAI models (including the latest GPT-5 family)
```
---
model: gpt-5  # or gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat-latest
system_commands: [act as a senior javascript developer]
---
```
prefix it with `ollama@` for Ollama models or `lmstudio@` for LM Studio models.
```
---
model: ollama@gemma2:27b
temperature: 1
---
```


The AI responses will keep the used model name in the response title for future reference.
You can find the list of your installed Ollama model names from your terminal via `ollama list` or the available openAI model names online on this [openAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) page.

### Service URLs
Each AI service has its own dedicated URL parameter that can be configured globally in settings or per-note via frontmatter:

```
---
# For OpenAI
openaiUrl: https://api.openai.com

# For OpenRouter
openrouterUrl: https://openrouter.ai

# For Ollama
ollamaUrl: http://localhost:11434
---
```

The default URLs are:
- OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com`
- OpenRouter: `https://openrouter.ai`
- Ollama: `http://localhost:11434`

Note: Previous versions used a single `url` parameter which is now deprecated. Please update your templates and notes to use the service-specific URL parameters.

### Commands 👨‍💻
Run commands from Obsidian's command pallet via `cmd + p` or `ctrl + p` and start typing `chatgpt` or set hotkeys
(a chat command hotkey is highly recommended for effortless chats (I use `cmd + j`, which works fantastic, because your index finger is already resting on that key)).

#### Main Command
- **Chat**: Parse the file and interact with ChatGPT. Assign a hotkey, e.g. `cmd + j`.
  
#### Creation Commands
- **New Chat with Highlighted Text**: Start a chat using highlighted text and default frontmatter in `Chat Folder`.
- **New Chat From Template**: Create chats from templates in `Chat Template Folder`.

#### Utility Commands
- **Infer Title**: Automatically generate a note title based on the notes content. Configurable to auto-run after 4+ messages.
- **Add Comment Block**: Insert comment blocks for parts of your note that should be ignored.
- **Select Model**: Choose from all available LLMs (OpenAI, OpenRouter.ai, Ollama) and set the current model for your note.

#### Maintenance Commands
- **Clear Chat**: Remove all messages while retaining frontmatter.
- **Stop Streaming (Desktop Only)**: Halt ongoing streams if necessary.

#### Formatting Tools
- **Add Divider**: Insert horizontal rulers to organize content visually.

## Beta Testing 🧪
Want to try the latest features before they're officially released? You can beta test ChatGPT MD using the [BRAT (Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool)](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) community plugin:

1. Install the BRAT plugin from Obsidian's Community Plugins
2. Open BRAT settings and add `bramses/chatgpt-md` as a beta plugin
3. Select "latest version" from the dropdown in the BRAT plugin settings
4. Enable the ChatGPT MD plugin in your community plugins list

This gives you early access to new features while they're still being developed and tested.

⚠️ **WARNING**: Beta testing is dangerous and happens at your own risk. Always test beta versions on a new empty vault, not on your main vault. Beta features can break and possibly lead to data loss.

## FAQs ❓
#### How do I start chatting with ChatGPT MD?
Use the `ChatGPT MD: Chat` command from the Obsidian command Palette (`cmd + p` or `ctrl + p`) to start a conversation from any note.

#### Can I set up a hotkey for the `ChatGPT MD: Chat` command?
Yes, you should! Go to `Settings > Hotkeys`, search for `ChatGPT MD: Chat` and add your preferred keybinding (e.g., `cmd + j`).

#### How do I use chat and reasoning models?
You can use OpenAI's GPT 3 and 4 models, various models through OpenRouter.ai (like Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity), or any model you have installed via Ollama.
DeepSeek-r1:7b works great for reasoning locally via Ollama.

#### How do I use a custom endpoint?
